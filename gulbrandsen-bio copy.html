                <h1>Cc Gulbrandsen – Bio</h1>

        <body>
            <p>At Syracuse, I major in magazine, news, and digital journalism with a fashion milestone focus, and minor in information technology and management. I am interested in pursuing a career in digital fashion design where I can be <strong>creative</strong> and <strong>inspired</strong> by those around me. </p>

            <p>I have been a writer for University Girl Magazine since my sophomore year and just started a position as VP of Social Media for NCSC. I have also done makeup for a Jerk Magazine photoshoot and would love to do more. </p>

            <h2>Personal Information</h2>

            <p>I will always love fashion and getting dressed up to try new restaurants with friends or just to stay at home and cook, but in my free time, I love being outdoors, reading a book on the beach, and going for a long nature walk. When the weather doesn’t permit being anywhere else but inside, I love to bake, scrapbook, or watch Gossip Girl (a classic for me), Breaking Bad (which I am yet to finish), or any cheesy rom-com (The Proposal gets me every time).</p>


            <p>I used to want to be an editor for a big magazine–Vogue: the crème de la crème for any young fashion writer's dream–but sometimes describing the way fabric makes me feel isn’t as exhilarating as the creative high I get from experimenting with designs. College has taught me that I don’t need to know exactly what I want to do or how I will get there but following inspiration is the only way to get anywhere. </p>
            <h4>Skills I hope to use in a future profession:</h4>
