    <h3>Bio</h3>
    <p>Hi! My name is Cc Gulbrandsen and I am a student at Syracuse University studying Magazine, News & Digital
        Journalism, and Information Management and Technology. Makeup has always been my favorite way to complete a look
        and I’ve been doing makeup on myself and my friends for a few years, experimenting with color, glitter, and
        neutrals. I love incorporating a pop of color into my looks whether it is placed subtly in the inner corner of
        the eye or on the cheeks for a sunkissed blush look. I recently began doing makeup for magazine shoots at
        Syracuse and I can’t wait to work with others to help bring my client’s visions to life. Some of my favorite
        looks are posted in my lookbook!</p>
